# Modern-Java

The Modern Java package contains four separate classes written in Java 9 using a functional programming style. All files also include proper Javadoc.

1) The Reverse class contains one static method that returns a parameterized list with elements in reverse order.

2) The PerfectNumbers class contains two static methods which print a range of perfect numbers.

3) The ChurchNumeral class represents an instance of a ChurchNumeral and contains instance methods to perform arithmetic operations on these and a method to convert them to a readable string. It also contains a static method that performs an arithmetic operation on a ChurchNumeral.

4) The Test class tests specific functions included in the three classes above.
